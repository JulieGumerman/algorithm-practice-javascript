//In my own words:
//1. The second parameter is a number n. 
//2. Add together the largest n numbers to return the largest sum

//For loop?
//cycle through and make an array of however many n numbers
//For loop # 2 (keeping it O(n) by keeping the loops separate and not nested)
//tally totals 
//return larges
